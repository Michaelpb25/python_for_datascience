Finished creating a new book at `./py4ds`
- Your content is in `./py4ds/content` 

- A Table of Contents file is at `./py4ds/_data/toc.yml`.
  You should check its contents, make sure it references your
  content correctly, and ensure it has the correct order.

- Your configuration file is at `./py4ds/_config.yml`.
  You should check its contents and double-check that the values  are correct for your site.


Notes
=====
- Add your own content to your book. You haven't provided any content (`--content-folder`)
  so we've added a couple files to get you started.
- We've added a CC-BY-SA license for you in ./py4ds/content/LICENSE.md
  This is a reasonable license for most book content, though feel free
  to change it if you like!
